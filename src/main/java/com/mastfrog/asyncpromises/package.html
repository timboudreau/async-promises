        <h1>Async Promises API</h1>
        <p>
            Asynchronous promises use the "promise" idiom to handle the case where
            the logic that does the work may be asynchronous and will not complete
            synchronously.  The logic of an AsyncPromise is passed a "trigger" object 
            which it will call when the work has either succeeded or failed.
        </p>
        <p>
            The library makes no assumptions that it knows how to run the logic that
            will be run - whatever it is simply calls the trigger when the work is
            complete.  So it is suitable for making calls to external asynchronus
            libraries where you don't control how or on what thread the subsequent
            logic will be run.
        </p>
        <h2>Use Case</h2>
        <p>
            It is not uncommon to have more than one callback-based library to wire
            together, or to have a sequence of asynchronous callbacks you want to
            execute, with a guarantee that they are all executed or you get notified
            in the case of failure.  In asynchronous libraries, it is common that they provide
            the plumbing that actually runs your callback, so promises shouldn't
            make an assumption that they can throw stuff in a thread pool to run
            themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
            This library can be used for synchronous promises as well - just call
            the passed trigger's <code>trigger()</code> method synchronously for
            that.
        </p>
        <h2>Usage</h2>
        <p>
            The basic way to use this library is to implement the class
            <a href='Logic.html'>Logic</a> or
            <a href='SimpleLogic.html'>SimpleLogic</a>, and pass that to 
            the static <code>AsyncPromise.create()</code> method.  The Logic interface
            is a <i>functional interface</i> which simply takes an input parameter
            and a <i>trigger</i> and a <i>context</i> (see below), and does something,
            which might be synchronous or asynchronous, but in either case, ends with
            a call to the trigger object to provide the results and possibly trigger
            the next promise to do something with that output, if running in a chain.
        </p>
        <p>
            The logic will not actually be run until the Promise's <code>start()</code>
            method is called (you pass it the initial input, which will be passed to your
            Logic implementation).
        </p>
        <h2>Chaining</h2>
        <p>
            AsyncPromises can be chained together, and one can accept as input the output of
            a previous one.  The result of chaining (using AsyncPromise's <code>then()</code>
            method is a new AsyncPromise which takes the original one's input type as input,
            and outputs the output type of the Logic or AsyncPromise instance you just passed.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, if you start with:
        </p>
        <pre>
            AsyncPromise&lt;A,B&gt;
        </pre>
        <p>
            and call <code>then</code> on it with a new Logic or promise parameterized on B, C, you
            get:
        </p>
        <pre>
            AsyncPromise&lt;A,B&gt; first = ...;
            AsyncPromise&lt;A,C&gt; chained = first.then(new Logic&lt;B, C&gt;() { ... });
        </pre>
        or using lambdas
        <pre>
            AsyncPromise&lt;A,C&gt; chained = first.then((B data, Trigger&lt;C&gt; next) -&gt; { ... });
        </pre>
        <p>
            and when you call <code>first.start(someA)</code>, the first and second will be run
            (you can pass an optional <code>Trigger</code> object to <code>start()</code> to
            collect the final results).
        </p>
        <p>
            If you want to chain together promises of heterogenous types, simply use the <code>then()</code>
            method that takes an input argument:
        </p>
        <pre>
            AsyncPromise&lt;A,B&gt; first = ...;
            AsyncPromise&lt;B,C&gt; second = ...;
            AsyncPromise&lt;Q,R&gt; third = ...;
            AsyncPromise&lt;A,R&gt; chained = first.then(second).then(new Q(), third);
        </pre>
        and then to actually execute all of the logic in sequence,
        <pre>
            A a = ...;
            chained.start(a);
        </pre>
        
        <h2>Promise Context</h2>
        <p>
            The <a href='PromiseContext.html'>PromiseContext</a> provides a way for decoupled
            Logic instances to communicate between themselves.  It is passed to Logic's method.
            Key objects - PromiseContext.Key - are used to store and retrieve data from it.
            The key instance must be known to both Logics:
        </p>
        <pre>
            static Key&lt;String&gt; NAME_KEY = PromiseContext.key(String.class);

            AsyncPromise&lt;A,B&gt;.create((A data, Trigger&lt;B&gt; trigger, PromiseContext context) -&gt; {
                String interestingString = ...;
                context.put(key, interestingString);
                ...
            });
            AsyncPromise&lt;B,C&gt;.create((A data, Trigger&lt;C&gt; trigger, PromiseContext context) -&gt; {
                String interestingString = context.get(NAME_KEY);
                ...
            });
        </pre>
        <h2>Failure Handling</h2>
        <p>
            The <a href="FailureHandler.html">FailureHandler</a> lets you handle errors that occured
            during asynchronous processing.  So you can attach a FailureHandler to a promise, and it
            will be notified in the case of failure.
        </p>
        <p>
            When building a chain of promises, multiple failure handlers may be attached to different
            steps in the promise;  on failure, the failure propagates backward to the nearest handler,
            which can return <code>true</code> from its <code>onFailure</code> method to indictate
            the failure should continue propagating backward to earlier failure handlers.
        </p>
        <p>
            A failure consists of <i>either</i> passing a <code>Throwable</code> to the trigger, or
            throwing an exception during logic execution.
        </p>
